        <p>A show about what happens after the hero's journey ends, in both adventure and life. It teaches you to appreciate the moment and to be like the absolute goat Himmel. Feet-kicking romance, no annoying tropes, and everything in this show is taken care of so well by the animation team. My personal favorite show of all time for how real all the characters are, to the point where you actually look forward to flashbacks. Watching it weekly was the highlight of every week. </p>
        <p>pls pls pls give me my season 2(its what Himmel would have wanted)</p>
